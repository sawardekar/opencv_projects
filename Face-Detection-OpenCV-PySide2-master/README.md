# Face-Detection-OpenCV-PySide2
It is a simple PySide2 desktop application that uses Haarcascade classfier from OpenCV to detect faces in a webcam video feed.

The application works as follows:

  - Launch the application by running the <i>main.py</i> file.
  
  - Can start and stop the webcam by using the avaiable QPushButtons.
  
  - Can toggle on and off the face detection implementation on the webcam feed by clicking the available QPushbutton.
  
 The user interface is made using Qt Designer.
